# Simple Calculator by Helena Chi
## For TechSmith Take-home Challenge

This calculator uses PyQt5 and Python 3.7.3. It includes four operations: `+, -, *, /` and only supports integer math. Expressions are evaluated from left to right; evaluation does not follow PEMDAS.
To run, use the command `python calculator.py`

Enjoy.
